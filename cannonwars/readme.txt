To install: double-click icon, go to actions->extract, make sure "all files" is selected, choose where,
and push extract

Controls: Up and down moves your cannon, left and right rotates camera, esc brings up option menu, home changes color, end increases gravity

Special thanks goes out to the most l337 opengl programmer, NeHe, and his great tutorials of which I would be
nothing without and to anyone else who has put anything opengl related on the net.

This is my first large-scale OpenGL project, I've learned a ton, and lots of work has gone into this.

This game has gone through too many changes to mention, it once was 3d, but it wasn't what expected, i guess I was aiming for the 2d look all along.

If you have any questions, gripes, bug reports, suggestions, wanna hear about future releases or wish to offer me praise :-D feel free to email me at bdwashbu@home.com

October 5, added comet-type trail
September 27, bouncing particles, better collision testing
September 7, tweaking and bug fixing, beta 1 is close.
September 6,  Anti-aliased cannons now, bug fixing.
September 5, Added anti-aliasing to the terrain, looks way better, added toggleable color changing and light based on color, added beginning terrain collison-testing, changed a bunch of GL_LINES to a big GL_LINE_STRIP, 5% faster
September 4, Added non-normal lighting extension, looks ok.
September 2, Added new terrain collision algoritm, much better.
August 28, Added changable-color cannonball trails (structures).
August 25, Finished the deformable-terrain extension, finally works like expected, but could be improved. Do that later.
August 23, Added cannonball trails

Features:

randomly generated terrain
collision detection
advanced particle system effected by gravity and wind
