Brian Washburn, 2003
Produced on a P550, Voodoo3.

This is my very first demo.  I made it within 3 days.  Im 17 and have been programming OpenGL for 2 years.

Scene 1: Triangles which organize themselves, projective texturing
Scene 2: Tunnel based on many sin waves
Scene 3: Texture based motion blur,  picture distortion
Scene 4: Complicated particle system, including many rotation values to add to realism
Scene 5: Projective texture based shadowing, the next best thing to stencil shadows
